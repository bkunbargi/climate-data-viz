# EcoVision Assessment - Technical Writeup

## Overview

This document outlines my approach and implementation details for the EcoVision Climate Visualizer take-home assessment.

## Time Investment

The assessment suggested 2 hours. I spent additional time to implement proper database migrations and API organization that I felt would be valuable in a production environment.

## Technical Decisions

### Flask-Migrate Integration
**What I added**: Complete database migration system using Flask-Migrate
- `migrate_db.py` script for easy migration management
- Migration commands: init, create, apply, history, current, downgrade
- Automated setup that initializes migrations alongside database creation
- Enables proper schema evolution without data loss

**Why Flask-Migrate?**
- Professional database schema management
- Safe migrations without data loss
- Easy rollback capabilities
- Standard practice for Flask applications

### API Organization with Blueprints
**What I implemented**: Modular route organization using Flask blueprints
- Separated endpoints into logical modules (`routes/climate.py`, `routes/summary.py`, etc.)
- Each route handles its own filtering and validation logic
- Main `app.py` registers blueprints for clean separation
- Scalable structure for adding new endpoints

**Why Blueprint Organization?**
- Separates concerns by feature
- Makes testing individual endpoints easier
- Scales better as API grows
- Standard Flask pattern for larger applications

### Database Models
**What I designed**: Clean SQLAlchemy model structure in dedicated `models.py`
- Three main models: Location, Metric, ClimateData
- Proper foreign key relationships
- Quality enum for data reliability tracking
- Designed for easy filtering and aggregation

**Why Separate Models File?**
- Keeps database logic organized
- Easier to maintain relationships
- Follows Flask best practices

## Frontend Integration
The frontend was largely provided with Chart.js already included. I focused on:
- Connecting the React components to the Flask API endpoints
- Ensuring proper data flow between frontend filters and backend queries
- Fixing consistency issues with initial data loading vs. filtered data

## Code Organization

### Backend Structure
```
backend/
├── app.py              # Main Flask app with blueprint registration
├── models.py           # SQLAlchemy models (Location, Metric, ClimateData)
├── routes/             # Modular API endpoints using blueprints
│   ├── climate.py      # Climate data endpoint
│   ├── locations.py    # Locations endpoint
│   ├── metrics.py      # Metrics endpoint
│   ├── summary.py      # Summary statistics endpoint
│   └── trends.py       # Trends analysis endpoint
├── setup.py           # Automated setup including migration init
├── migrate_db.py      # Migration management commands
└── init_db.py         # Database initialization with sample data
```

### Frontend Structure
```
frontend/
├── src/
│   ├── components/    # React components
│   ├── api.js        # API service for backend communication
│   └── App.jsx       # Main application component
└── package.json      # Dependencies (Chart.js already included)
```

## What I'd Improve With More Time

### Immediate
- Unit tests for API endpoints
- API documentation
- Better error handling in frontend

### Extended
- Data validation on API inputs
- Caching for frequently requested data
- Export functionality

## Conclusion

The main value I added was implementing proper database migration tooling and organizing the API with Flask blueprints. Helpful for maintaining a Flask application in a team environment.
